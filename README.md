## üéØ The Problem

Youth across India, especially from **rural areas, tribal districts, and urban slums**, face a significant challenge when applying for internships. As first-generation learners with limited digital exposure, they are often overwhelmed by hundreds of listings. This leads to:
* **Information Overload:** Inability to identify relevant opportunities.
* **Misaligned Applications:** Applying for internships that don't match their skills or aspirations.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Overlooking ideal internships due to a complex discovery process.
