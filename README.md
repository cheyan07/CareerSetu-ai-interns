Here is the clean, corrected text for your README.md file. You can copy this entire block and paste it directly into GitHub.

CareerSetu is an intelligent, AI-powered internship recommendation engine built for the Smart India Hackathon. Our mission is to bridge the opportunity gap for students across India, especially first-generation learners and those in remote areas, by providing simple, personalized, and actionable career guidance.

üéØ The Problem
The PM Internship Scheme portal lists hundreds of opportunities, creating a significant challenge for students who lack prior experience or digital literacy. This information overload leads to:

Decision Paralysis: Students are overwhelmed by too many choices.

Misaligned Applications: Students apply for internships that don't match their skills or interests.

Missed Opportunities: The most promising candidates miss out on the best-fit opportunities because they can't find them.

Our target users are often first-generation learners from rural areas, tribal districts, and remote colleges who need a guiding hand, not just a search bar.

‚ú® Our Solution: CareerSetu
CareerSetu (meaning "Career Bridge") is a lightweight, mobile-first platform that cuts through the noise. Instead of a long, confusing list, we provide 3-5 highly relevant, personalized internship suggestions in a clean, easy-to-understand format.
